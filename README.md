# Country_Income_Model

This project is part of a data science assignment at UNAM.  
We built and evaluated three supervised learning models to classify countries based on their income level using GDP and other economic indicators.

## Objective

Classify countries into:
- Low income
- Middle income
- High income

‚Ä¶based on their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and additional socio-economic features.

## Models

We trained and evaluated the following models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear, ploy and RBF Kernels 

Evaluation was done using **5-fold cross-validation**, comparing:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score

## Result

The model with the best overall performance across all metrics was: **SVM with RBF kernel**
